Getting Started
---------------

If you just want to explore Clearwater functionality and you're not ready to play with scaling out Clearwater in a Cloud environment, then you should start with the "all-in-one" installable, which packages all Clearwater elements together for deployment on a single virtual machine. This is available in two formats: as an [Amazon Machine Image](https://aws.amazon.com/amis/) which you can deploy on Amazon EC2, or as an [Open Virtualization Format](https://dmtf.org/standards/ovf) image, which you can deploy on any virtualization platform that supports OVF, such as [VMware Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/player/), [VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor/overview.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). You can find instructions for how to get and install all-in-one Clearwater [here](https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-docs/wiki/All-in-one%20Images). The standard (multi-VM) Clearwater binary distribution is most easily installed on [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). That's the native environment we use for development. You need a minimum of five virtual machines with [Ubuntu 12.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/), and you can install the software manually from the Clearwater Debian packages. You will then need to configure DNS and security groupings to enable the various components to find each other and connect securely. If you wish to install a larger deployment of Clearwater, for example for scalability testing, you can automate the installation of multiple instances of each of the Clearwater components using [Chef](https://www.opscode.com/chef/). The distribution includes tools for using Chef to spin up Clearwater deployments of any arbitrary size on Amazon AWS. If you want to deploy Clearwater in some other public or private Cloud environment, and you are able to use Ubuntu 12.04, then you should be able to install manually from the Debian packages. For other operating systems, you may need to build Clearwater from the source code.
