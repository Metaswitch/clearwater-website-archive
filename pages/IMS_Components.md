## Clearwater IMS Components

Clearwater consists of a number of IMS components:

*   **I-CSCF**
*   **S-CSCF**
*   **BGCF**
*   P-CSCF
*   A basic HSS
*   An IR.92 Application Server
*   An XDMS to support this application server
*   Self service provisioning portal
*   WebRTC - IMS SIP gateway

The Clearwater team are currently focusing their efforts on the Clearwater IMS Core pieces - the I-CSCF, S-CSCF and BGCF - with the aim of making these suitable for deployment to support live IMS deployments - such as in VoLTE networks. The remainder of the pieces are provided to show-case the Clearwater IMS core capabilities, but it is expected that in live deployments external IMS components will be used to provide functionality such as P-CSCF, HSS, MMTel TAS. An explanation of how these IMS components are implemented within Clearwater is available on the [architecture](Architecture.md) page.
