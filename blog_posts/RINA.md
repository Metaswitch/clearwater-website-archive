Project Clearwater over RINA
----------------------------
A couple of weeks ago, I attended the [TADHack Global hackathon](https://tadhack.com/2017/global/) in London, and hacked on porting Clearwater to RINA, the [Recursive InterNetwork Architecture](http://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_InterNetwork_Architecture_(RINA)), a modern replacement for both TCP and IP. It's still fairly early days for RINA, but I was pleased to get Clearwater's HTTP communications running over it (albeit a little after the end of the hackathon). You can read more on the hack, and the trials and tribulations of trying out bleeding-edge networking stacks over on the [TADHack blog](http://blog.tadhack.com/2017/10/11/project-clearwater-over-rina/).
